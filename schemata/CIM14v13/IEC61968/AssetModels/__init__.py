"""This package is an extension of Assets package and contains the core information classes that support asset management and different network and work planning applications with specialized documentation classes describing assets of a particular product model made by a manufacturer. There are typically many instances of an asset associated with a single asset model. It also contains 'lightweight' *Info classes, which hold model attributes that can be referenced by not only Assets but also by ConductingEquipments.
